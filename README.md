In this interactive environment, students learn about place value and practice regrouping by playing with birds.

[May-Li Khoe](http://maylikhoe.com) and [Andy Matuschak](http://andymatuschak.org) made this demo during Khan Academy's [Healthy Hackathon IV](http://healthyhackathon.khanacademy.org).

# Next

If we continued with this prototype, we'd next have the student practice two-digit addition and subtraction by [having them move two-digit numbers of birds between houses](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andymatuschak/place-value/master/Counting%20and%20place%20value%206%20futures.png?token=AAAK0_AFO3YcQC-PfosP89rIwhye6Qsvks5VyRqrwA%3D%3D).

Then we might reveal how the operations they're performing correspond to the traditional multidigit arithmetic algorithms.
